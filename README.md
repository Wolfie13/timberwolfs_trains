# Timberwolf's Trains

A set of UK trains.

## Scale

This set takes advantage of the larger canvas in MagicaVoxel to have larger, more detailed objects.

The scale is based on a "typical" vehicle such as a Mark Two coach being roughly 192x40x60, a slightly exaggerated size
designed to fit with the OpenTTD scale.

This gives a scale as follows:

Length: 10 voxels/m
Width:  15 voxels/m
Height: 15 voxels/m

In this scale a Mark Two coach is 196x42x58.

Some useful properties:

BR standard wheel diameter of 3'6 = 15 voxels

"Realistic" track gauge would be 21 voxels (round up to 22). OpenTTD's standard is to be somewhat broad gauge compared to
UK prototypes, so for models to sit right on tracks this should be at least 26 voxels with 4 voxel wide wheels. This 
"broad gauge" effect can be compensated for by moving vehicle bodies down 4 voxels, giving the appearance of a narrower
track gauge.

Note that for most vehicles it will be useful to round them to the nearest size for their in-game length.

## Colours

Base 2cc primary colour = 204
Base 2cc secondary colour = 86

End plate yellow = 69
